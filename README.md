This GitHub repository contains the source code used for the article "Language emergence with a dislexic receiver" (https://osf.io/es572). It also contains a Beamer presentation of the project.

## Abstract

In an experimental language emergence, adding human-like constraints such as laziness and impatience to a classical communication game makes the emergent language more similar to natural languages as for the distribution of message lengths when ranked by their frequency. In particular, the relation between words frequency and length in the new language respects Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation (ZLA). We wondered what the influence of another human-like characteristic, dyslexia, would be on the emergent language, and implemented this in the article’s code. We found that dyslexia is making communication a lot harder, increasing the number of useless symbols in communication. However, if the dyslexia is not too frequent, communication with a full understanding is possible.
